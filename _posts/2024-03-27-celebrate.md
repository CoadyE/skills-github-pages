#Celbrate!
On this day, 5 years ago I received my Iron Ring.  My parents were there to watch me get my ring and my mom was the one who "ringed" me.   I was very happy to follow in my parents footsteps and that all  my hard work throughout school had paid off.  As I write this post now, in a cafe in mount pleasant, I still wear my ring even though I don't practice mechanical engineering.  I'm very proud of it and it reminds me how far I've come. 

I'm looking forward to seeing what the next 5 years in store.  Where will I be on March 27, 2029?
